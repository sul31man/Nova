          <h2 className="section-title">Overview</h2>
          <p className="product-description">
          Engineering and STEM students are wasting years grinding on assignments that don’t matter. You learn theory, jump through hoops, and then face a job market clogged with gatekeepers and endless interviews. You end up underutilised, waiting for permission to start your career.
          </p>

          <p className="product-description">
          <strong>Nova is the alternative.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="product-description">
          Here, you don’t wait to be chosen — you <strong>sign up to a mission</strong>. If you complete it,<strong> you get paid instantly</strong>. No gatekeeping. No interview hoops. Just proof of ability.
          </p>

          <p className="product-description">
          You join as an <strong>Operator Node</strong> in the Nova <strong>Cluster</strong>. The Morphic IDE reshapes itself to each mission, teaches you missing skills in the flow, validates your output, and pays you on success. Every completion <strong>levels up your node</strong>, unlocking harder, better-paid projects, while the Scheduler routes you into squads and swarms where your strengths compound.
          </p>

          <p className="product-description">
          Phase 1 begins with STEM and engineering work — data ops, CAD annotation, test automation, sourcing parts — but the path is clear: Nova grows into a global system where <strong>every human becomes a node in the cluster</strong>, learning, building, and solving problems together at planetary scale.
          </p>
          <p className="product-description">
          And unlike gig platforms, Nova’s <strong>Cluster Scheduler</strong> exists for one reason: to keep you employed. Its algorithm is designed to match you with the right missions, teach you what you need in real time, and optimise the Morphic IDE around you — maximising your <strong>signal to noise ratio</strong> so you’re always learning, always building, and always earning.
          </p>
          <p className="product-description">
          Nova’s Cluster Scheduler doesn’t just find you work — it <strong>curates your entire journey</strong>. It starts you with missions easy enough to reward you quickly, then steadily escalates difficulty and impact so you <strong>never stagnate</strong>.At every step, you're rewarded and levelled up, guided by the optimal learning plan, workbench, and project sequence.<p><strong> The goal is simple: to push you into becoming the best engineer you can be — a 10x architect of human civilisation — by keeping you always learning, always earning, and always building </strong></p>

          <p className="product-description">
            Phase 1 trains engineers on real-world tasks; the endgame is a world where all work is mission-based, all learning is in-flow, and every human is activated as a node in the global cluster — building software, hardware, and civilisation itself.
