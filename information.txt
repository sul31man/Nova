the website needs the following :

A Home page explaining the product ( manifesto)

A tasks page. (The tasks page should be such that you have an engineering problem and an AI continuously asks you more question about the engineering problem and then spits this out into a certain number of tasks ( you choose ) which people can choose from and start working on)

furthermore, the tasks page should be split between a place to choose tasks and to upload these tasks in the manner i just described

An education page ( this will figureout what skills people want to build and create a taylored plan for learning within the time frame they want. It has to be as efficient as possible, when we go onto the education tab, therell be a button which will take them to a new education section which asks questions and creates a map of what they need to do. SPOON FEED PEOPLE!!!)

Note: OpenAI API key is now stored securely in backend/.env file (see SETUP.md for configuration instructions)
